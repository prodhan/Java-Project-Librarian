Abstract of Library System The client uses MS Excel, and maintains their records, however it is not possible them to share the data from multiple system in multi user environment, there is lot of duplicate work, and chance of mistake. When the records are changed, they need to update each and every excel file. There is no option to find and print previous saved records. There is no security; anybody can access any report and sensitive data, also no reports to summary report.
